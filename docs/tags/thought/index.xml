      <description>A temporal paradox, time paradox, or time travel paradox is an apparent contradiction, or logical contradiction associated with the idea of time and time travel.
Casual Loop The casual loop is a paradox in which a future event causes the past event which leads to the future event. For example a billiard ball moves to a time travel machine and travels to its past and strikes the past self towards the time machine.</description>

      <description>We know that gravity is a force of attraction between two bodies due to their masses. More the mass of a body, higher the gravitational force it exerts. Gravity is what keeps us on the ground (not letting us fly into space when we jump off the ground).
What happens without gravity in space? We have seen clips from the space station. Due to lack of gravity, astronauts are able to fly around the space station.</description>

      <description>Imagine if humans had control of the weather! There would be no floods or hurricanes. Farming would become much more easy. We could reverse climate change and bring any kind of weather in any region. There wonâ€™t be any extreme hot or cold weathers. There are many possibilities, but who will control the weather? What kind of weather would everyone like? How can we possibly control the weather? Could there be side effects and downsides to this?</description>
