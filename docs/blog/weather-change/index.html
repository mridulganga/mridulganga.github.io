<p>Imagine if humans had control of the weather! There would be no floods or hurricanes. Farming would become much more easy. We could reverse climate change and bring any kind of weather in any region. There won’t be any extreme hot or cold weathers. There are many possibilities, but who will control the weather? What kind of weather would everyone like?
How can we possibly control the weather? Could there be side effects and downsides to this?</p>
<h2 id="who-will-control-the-weather">Who will control the weather?<a class="anchor" href="#who-will-control-the-weather">#</a></h2>
<p>There are three categories of people who could control the weather - The government, the industries/ capitalists and the public. If the government had the control, the weather would most likely be a mix of moderate sunny, rainy and cold weathers. They would certainly ensure that farms get enough water and sunlight. It will be a repetitive one more or less which people might get bored of soon.
If the capitalists had control over it, they would not worry much about the farms unless they are in that sector. They would prefer a cool and breezy weather which they find comfortable. This might not be the best for the planet or farms.
If people had the weather control, we would require a system where they can vote for what weather they want. We can’t expect them to vote for each time slot having what weather. It will be a repetitive pattern which they can vote to change slightly. Maybe if there is an evening rain, they can vote for it to make a windy evening and night rain.</p>
<h2 id="what-kind-of-weather-would-everyone-like">What kind of weather would everyone like?<a class="anchor" href="#what-kind-of-weather-would-everyone-like">#</a></h2>
<p>Everyone has varied opinions, some like sunny weather, some like rainy, some like windy and some like it cold. It can become very difficult to take into account everyone’s opinions. Going with the natural flow - mornings are usually on the cooler side, afternoods are sunny and hot sometimes, evenings are cool and occasionally windy, nights are cool. Rain is unpredictable - mornings, afternoons and nights. We could make modifications to this rhythm and make mornings cool and breezy with occasional rains, afternoons can be sunny but not too hot, evenings can be windy and cool, nights can be cold with rain. This will give most people good balanced overall weather, it will give enough sunlight and rain to the plants.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-we-possibly-control-the-weather">How can we possibly control the weather?<a class="anchor" href="#how-can-we-possibly-control-the-weather">#</a></h2>
<p>There are multiple ways to do this - one is by individually controlling the factors
For sunny weather, we will need to disperse the clouds. For rainy weather - artificial precipitation (cloud seeding). For cold weather - a denser layer of clouds to let lesser sunlight in and snow precipitation. For windy - temperature variations at different locations to create air flow from cold to hot regions and maybe some other practical ways.
Another way could be to control the weather city or town wise. Make a huge transparent dome that covers a city and condition the weather inside that dome. It is much easier to control the weather of one city than try to control the weather of a bigger region. It can also give a chance to have large variations in weather specific to each city.
How will the dome work? For cold weather- the dome can reflect sunlight and allow hot air to escape with artificial air coolers. For rainy - just sprinkle water from a water source nearby. For sunny - allow sunlight inside the dome. So as we see, it becomes much easier to completely control the weather inside a dome.</p>
<h2 id="what-could-be-the-side-effects-of-weather-control">What could be the side effects of weather control?<a class="anchor" href="#what-could-be-the-side-effects-of-weather-control">#</a></h2>
<p>A major question is who will have the actual control over the weather. This is a debatable topic. Maybe climate change will take pace because of all the weather manipulation we are doing. Climate change does not only involve global warming but also a gradual irreversible shift in the overall climate of the earth. With weather control it is inevitable.</p>
