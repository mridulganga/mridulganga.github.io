      <description>What does it mean when we say peer to peer? P2P is direct connection between two devices to transfer data to-and-fro without the need of a central server. The traffic does not go to or from any central server, but directly from one device to the other.
What is WebRTC? WebRTC stands for web real-time communications. WebRTC was not supported by all the browsers until recently and is also available in most mobile browsers.</description>

      <description>Imagine if humans had control of the weather! There would be no floods or hurricanes. Farming would become much more easy. We could reverse climate change and bring any kind of weather in any region. There wonâ€™t be any extreme hot or cold weathers. There are many possibilities, but who will control the weather? What kind of weather would everyone like? How can we possibly control the weather? Could there be side effects and downsides to this?</description>
